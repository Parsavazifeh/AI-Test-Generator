Given the following UI element:

Element ID: {element_id}
Element XPath: {element_xpath}
Element Name: {element_name}

Dependencies: {dependencies}

Generate a complete Selenium-based UI test for this element. The output must:
- Include all necessary imports (e.g. `from selenium import webdriver`, etc.) at the top.
- Configure the WebDriver to run in headless mode.
- Locate the element using its ID or XPath.
- Perform an interaction with the element (such as clicking, typing, or selecting).
- Include assertions to verify the expected behavior after the interaction.
- Include error handling for cases where the element is not found or not interactable.
- Return all test code in a single, self-contained Python code block without any extra commentary or chain-of-thought markers.
