Function details:
Name: {function_name}
Signature: {arguments} -> {return_type}
Description: {docstring}

Write a complete PyTest integration test suite for this function. The output must:
- Include all necessary imports (e.g. `import pytest`) at the top.
- Either include the function definition or assume it is already available.
- Define one or more test functions with names starting with "test_".
- Cover typical cases as well as edge cases (for example, empty inputs, None values, and invalid types).
- Use assertions (and `pytest.raises` where needed) to verify correct outputs or expected exceptions.
- Use mocks only if the function depends on external resources.
- Return all test code in a single, self-contained Python code block without any extra commentary or chain-of-thought markers.
