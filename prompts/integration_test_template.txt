Given the Python function below:

Function Name: {function_name}
Arguments: {arguments}
Return Type: {return_type}
Docstring: {docstring}

Dependencies: {dependencies}

Generate a complete PyTest integration test suite for this function. The output must:
- Include all necessary imports (e.g. `import pytest`) at the top.
- Either include the function definition or assume it is already available.
- Define one or more test functions with names starting with "test_".
- Cover typical scenarios using real dependency behavior.
- Cover edge cases such as network failures or invalid responses from external dependencies.
- Include assertions (and use `pytest.raises` where needed) to verify correct outputs or expected exceptions.
- Mock only the external dependencies that are not under test.
- Return all test code in a single, self-contained Python code block without any extra commentary or chain-of-thought markers.
